# AI
Welcome to AI. This Unity project demonstrates various elements of Artificial Intelligence.

## Description
<p align="justify">
On Christmas Eve in the village, a special visitor arrives: Father Christmas. As the user approaches a group of NPCs hudled around a fire, the children NPCs recognise him and ask whether he has brought gifts. True to his role, Father Christmas engages in a dialogue with them. After a realisation that they will not receive presents, they invite him to join in toasting marshmallows. Heading to the sweet stall, accompanied by an NPC dog, the user interacts with the sweet stall trader NPCs to collect marshmallows. After an exchange, Father Christmas returns to the fire, sharing the marshmallows with the eagarly awating NPC children. 

# Features
### Interactable NPCs

Depending on the user's proximity to the children NPCs, an appropriate dialogue exchange is triggered. The purpose of the dialogue is to establish if the user has brought gifts for the boy NPC. If the girl NPC is triggered, she asks if the user has brought gifts for her brother. If the user triggers the boy NPC a number of questions are asked and appropriate animated reactions are shown, including sadness and happiness. The child asks the user if they would like to toast marshmallows and after agreeing the child directs the user to the sweet stall.
